# What is this?

This is JDroid's code for the Rover Ruckus season. Yes, all of our code is public. 
~~And it is totally not because we don't want to pay for Github.~~ 
But seriously, one of the reasons our code is public is because it can be a good resource for team. It also helps advertise for robotlib.
