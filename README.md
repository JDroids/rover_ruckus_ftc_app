# What is this?

This is JDroids' code for the Rover Ruckus season. Yes, all of our code is public. 
~~And it is totally not because we don't want to pay for Github.~~ 
But seriously, one of the reasons our code is public is because it can be a good resource for teams, because I would like to think we have at least kind of okâ„¢ code. It also helps advertise for robotlib. 
Check out [robotlib](https://github.com/JDroids/robotlib).
